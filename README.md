# Hands-on-with-ML-Worksheet

This Project will be a work sheet for each chapter in [Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras and TensorFlow:](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/)<br />

**Why do a WorkSheet:** As a self taught data scientist I offten have found myself wondering if I know a topic or did I just read it, in an academic setting you have tests and by the end of that you will know if you know a subject or not.
So in order to deal with this issue I will be making a worksheet for a book I recently read in hopes it helps people make sure they know the matirail.<br/>

WorkSheet_1: CH2: End-to-End Machine Learning Project
  - we will be using an a data set about diamond prices found on seaborn
